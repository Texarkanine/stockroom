# sr-query

`sr-query` runs **read-only SQL** against the stockroom warehouse — the single-file DuckDB database of your captured Cursor + Claude Code history. The surface is read-only by construction: DuckDB rejects any write attempted through it, so you cannot corrupt anything by querying.

## When to use sr-query

Reach for `sr-query` when the question has a **known shape** and the answer is an exact or structured lookup over fields you can name:

- A specific row by id (`WHERE message_id = '…'`, `WHERE session_id = '…'`).
- Filters, counts, and rollups (`COUNT(*)`, `GROUP BY harness`, `WHERE harness = 'claude'`, token sums, date ranges).
- Joins across `sessions` / `messages` / `tool_calls`.
- "How many", "which sessions", "list the tool calls", "what models" — anything you can express as SQL over named columns.

**Do not** use `sr-query` for *meaning-based* recall ("find conversations about flaky tests"). SQL `ILIKE` is a literal substring match, not semantic search — for meaning, use the **`sr-semantic`** skill. When you are not sure which is right, that judgement belongs to the **`sr-search`** skill.

## How to invoke the engine

```bash
stockroom query "SELECT DISTINCT harness FROM sessions ORDER BY harness"
```

You can also pipe SQL from stdin with `-`:

```bash
echo "SELECT count(*) FROM messages" | stockroom query -
```

If `command -v stockroom` fails, the machine isn't set up yet: tell the user to run the **`sr-initialize`** skill, and don't attempt any other invocation.

## Output discipline: `--format` and `--detail`

**The defaults are already safe for an agent** — a bare call gives bounded, parseable output — so reach for the flags only when a situation calls for it.

### `--format` — output shape, default `tsv`

| Value | Shape | Use it when |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `tsv` *(default)* | Header row + tab-separated rows, no count trailer | Default. Stream-friendly for you and for unix pipes (`cut`, `awk`, `wc -l`). |
| `json` | A single `{"columns": [...], "rows": [...]}` object | A **user** asks for structured/machine output, or you want to hand it to `jq`. |
| `table` | Column-aligned ASCII with a `(N rows)` trailer | A **user** asks for something human-readable / a copy-paste command to look at. |

Lead with the default `tsv`. Offer `--format table` or `--format json` **when the user asks** for human-readable or structured output — "these other shapes exist if you want them."

### `--detail` — per-field width, default `snippet`

Wide string fields (notably `messages.text` and `tool_calls.tool_input`) are truncated **at read time** so one fat column can't flood your context. Truncation is display-only — full text is always retrievable.

| Value | Budget per field | Use it when |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| `compact` | ~40 chars | Scanning many candidate rows cheaply before picking one. |
| `snippet` *(default)* | ~120 chars | Default. Enough to recognize a row without dumping it. |
| `full` | unbounded | You need the **whole** field — typically a re-fetch of one row after a snippet showed `…(+N)`. |

An over-budget field is elided with a marker reporting how many characters were hidden, e.g. `…(+2284)`. That marker is your signal that more exists: if you actually need it, re-fetch **just that field for the specific row** at `--detail full` (see guardrails).

## Guardrails

These are the failure modes this skill exists to prevent:

- **Don't blow out your context.** Never `SELECT *` (or a wide `text` column) at `--detail full` across many rows. Instead: scan narrow at `--detail compact`/`snippet` with an explicit column list and a `LIMIT`, identify the row you want, then re-fetch only that row's wide field at `--detail full` with a `WHERE` on its id. A single `SELECT text FROM messages WHERE message_id = '…'` at `--detail full` is cheap; `SELECT * FROM messages --detail full` is a context bomb.
- **It is read-only — never attempt writes.** `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` / `CREATE` all fail (`query failed: …`). Do not retry a write through a different phrasing; the surface only interrogates.
- **`tool_input` is heterogeneous JSON.** Its keys vary per tool (`Shell` has `command`, `Read` has `path`, …), so a naive `tool_input->>'key'` can raise a cast error. Extract safely by filtering `tool_name` in a subquery/CTE first and using the explicit function:

```bash
stockroom query "SELECT json_extract_string(tool_input, '\$.command') AS cmd
  FROM (SELECT tool_input FROM tool_calls WHERE tool_name = 'Shell') LIMIT 5"
```

### Handle errors without thrashing

Each failure is a clean stderr message + exit code — read it and take the matching action, don't loop:

| Message | Exit | What it means / next action |
|---------|------|------------------------------|
| `error: empty query (…)` | 2 | No SQL was passed. Provide a statement. |
| `error: no warehouse found at … — run \`stockroom ingest\` first` | 1 | The warehouse hasn't been built. Tell the user to run `stockroom ingest` (or `sr-initialize` if the machine was never set up); don't retry the query. |
| `query failed: …` | 1 | Invalid SQL, or a write was rejected. Fix the statement (read the DuckDB message) — don't re-run the same SQL. |

## What's in the warehouse

**Discover the live schema first** — this stays correct as the schema evolves:

```bash
stockroom query "SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type
  FROM information_schema.columns ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position"
```

Quick reference of the load-bearing columns **as of migrations 0001–0004** (confirm with the introspection query above):

- **`sessions`** — one row per conversation. `harness` (`'cursor'`|`'claude'`), `session_id`, `project_id` (verbatim project-dir slug — the grouping key), `cwd` (real path, may be `NULL`), `models` (`VARCHAR[]`, Cursor only), `title`, `git_branch`, `is_subagent`, `parent_session_id`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `source_mtime` (source transcript mtime at last ingest). PK `(harness, session_id)`.
- **`messages`** — one row per turn. `message_id = '{session_id}#{ordinal}'` (uniform across harnesses), `parent_id`, `ordinal`, `role` (`'user'`|`'assistant'`), `text` (whole; thinking is **not** captured), `model` (per-message, Claude only), `ts`, `first_seen_at` (when stockroom first observed the message), and four token `BIGINT`s: `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_creation_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`. PK `(harness, session_id, message_id)`.
- **`tool_calls`** — tool **inputs only** (never outputs). `message_id` (the turn that emitted it), `ordinal`, `tool_name`, `tool_input` (heterogeneous `JSON`, stored whole — see the guardrail). PK `(harness, session_id, message_id, ordinal)`.
- **`embeddings`** — per-chunk vectors for semantic search (`owner_table`, `owner_id`, `chunk_index`, `embed_model`, `vector FLOAT[384]`). You rarely query this directly — use the `sr-semantic` skill.
- **`_sync_state`** — ingest watermark bookkeeping; not interesting to query.

One identity rule worth knowing before you write a join: always join on the uniform `message_id` / `(harness, session_id)`, never on the `source_*` provenance columns. A value that only exists at one grain per harness is honestly `NULL` for the other (e.g. `messages.model` is Claude-only; `sessions.models` is Cursor-only).

## Worked examples

All verified against a real warehouse.

```bash
# Which harnesses are present? (tsv default)
stockroom query "SELECT DISTINCT harness FROM sessions ORDER BY harness"

# Session counts per harness, human-readable for a user:
stockroom query --format table "SELECT harness, count(*) AS n FROM sessions GROUP BY harness ORDER BY n DESC"

# Busiest tools:
stockroom query "SELECT tool_name, count(*) AS calls FROM tool_calls GROUP BY tool_name ORDER BY calls DESC LIMIT 5"

# Scan candidate messages cheaply, then re-fetch the one you want in full:
stockroom query --detail compact "SELECT message_id, text FROM messages WHERE text ILIKE '%flaky test%' LIMIT 10"
stockroom query --detail full    "SELECT text FROM messages WHERE message_id = '<id-from-the-scan>'"

# Structured output for a user/tool to consume:
stockroom query --format json "SELECT harness, session_id, title FROM sessions WHERE title IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5"
```

## Relaying to a human

You are the tool's operator, not its display. Run the SQL, read the result, and **answer the user in natural language**. Don't paste raw tsv at a human unless they asked to see it. When they *do* want the raw output — or a command to run themselves — hand them a `--format table` (to read) or `--format json` (to process) variant.

## Understanding the system

To understand *why* these contracts look the way they do — the packaging, the torch contract, read-only-by-construction, the truncation doctrine, identity/provenance — read the shared system model: [`../sr-search/references/system-model.md`](../sr-search/references/system-model.md).
